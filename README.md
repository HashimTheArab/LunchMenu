# This is my first time using Rust
This program grabs my schools lunch menu and formats it into a nice table.
I made this because they formatted it like a list, and you have to scroll down to see the options. 
You can't see all the options at once which is inconvenient.

# Disclaimer
    This will not work without my schools website link which is not
    in the code because I don't want to dox myself :) if you go to 
    my school you're able to use this.
